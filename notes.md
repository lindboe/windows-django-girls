# Notes about what to improve

* Repeated sections are confusing
  * "Brief intro to the command line" in install page, but also a top-level link is "Intro to command line". Group thought they were on the same page when they weren't.
  * Python installation/Django installation repeated. Maybe have different versions of this tutorial for in person vs. not if the different ordering is that important?
  
* Emphasize that code blocks say where to run/paste them

* Windows: cmd, vs powershell, vs 

* Editor
  * How to open the project
  * How to add a new file and save it
  * Difference between panes: multiple file tabs, and included terminal pane is useful, but not clearly distinct from files

* The cmd window gets closed a few times, but we need to be back in our virtualenv for some tasks. Should have a quick reference for the command to activate it.
  * I ended up encouraging my team to create their own "cheatsheets", and that this should be the first thing they add to it

* hard to figure out which parts of commands to copy/replace
    * left out user.email in git config thinking it needed replacement
